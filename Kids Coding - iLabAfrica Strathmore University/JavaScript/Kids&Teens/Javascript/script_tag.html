<h2 id = 'JavaScript'>Intro to JavaScript Functions</h2>

<p>
    Functions are like magic spells in JavaScript that make things happen on your web page.<br>
    We write functions to do specific tasks, like saying hello or calculating numbers.<br>
    To use a function, you just say its name, and it does its job!<br>
    <br>
    We create a function using a special word, function, followed by its name and what it should do inside {}.<br>
    For example: function sayHello() { alert("Hello!"); }.<br>
    To make the function do its thing, we call it by its name, like sayHello();<br>

    We can put our JavaScript code in two places: <b>head or body </b>
    If we want something to happen as soon as the page loads, we put our code in the head.
    If we want something to happen when the user interacts with the page, like clicking a button, we put our code in the 
    body.
